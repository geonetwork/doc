Writing documentation
#####################

This section provides some guidelines for writing consistent documentation
for GeoNetwork.



.. seealso::

  The quickest and easiest way to contribute to the documentation is to sign up
  for a `GitHub account <https://github.com/>`_ and edit the documentation pages by clicking the
  "Edit on GitHub" link at the top of the page. (See :repo:`doc`).


Building the docs
=================

The following tools are required to build the documentation from source:

*  **Java JDK 1.8**, **Python**
*  **Maven 3.1.0+**: Once installed `Maven <https://maven.apache.org>`_ should be available in your command shell as ``mvn``.
*  **make**: Once installed `make <https://www.gnu.org/software/make/>`_ should be available in your command shell as ``make``.
*  **Sphinx**: See `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html>`_  for details. Once installed confirm it's available by running ``sphinx-build --version``.
*  **sphinx-bootstrap-theme**.

To install the build tools:

.. code-block:: shell

    sudo apt install make
    sudo apt install python3-pip
    sudo pip install sphinx
    sudo pip install sphinx-bootstrap-theme
    sudo pip install sphinx_rtd_theme



Then build the documentation in English using the following commands:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/geonetwork/doc
    cd doc
    mvn clean install

Once the documentation has built without errors, access the html files from ``doc\target\en\index.html``.


To build all documentation in several languages (right now: es,fr,ge,it,ko,nl,cz,ca,fi,is), based on Transifex translations:

.. code-block:: shell

  mvn clean install -Pall


If you want to get the latest translations for your build, run:

.. code-block:: shell

  mvn clean install -Platest,all

Building the standards docs
===========================

.. important:: Documentation about the standards and the editor configuration is built from the GeoNetwork source code using the ``schema-doc`` plugin. So do not manually edit the following files:

* docs/manuals/source/annexes/standards/*
* docs/manuals/source/customizing-application/editor-ui/creating-custom-editor.rst

Do not translate those files in Transifex. Translation must be done in the plugin itself.
To update those files, clone the GeoNetwork repository and use the following commands:


.. code-block:: shell

  cd docs/schema-doc
  mvn clean install

Check the updated files and commit to the doc repository.



Editing the reStructuredText files
==================================

To update the documentation, use a text editor to edit ``.rst`` files. Ensure you are using the correct terminology by
checking :ref:`style-guide`. Save
your changes, build the documentation and open the HTML files to preview
the changes. When your changes are ready to be submitted to the project, follow
the steps in :ref:`making-a-pull-request`.



Sphinx
======

This section gives some useful tips about using Sphinx.


Don’t introduce any new warnings
--------------------------------

When building the docs, Sphinx prints out warnings about broken links,
syntax errors and so on. Don't introduce new ones.


It’s best to delete the build directory and completely rebuild the docs,
to check for any warnings:

.. code-block:: shell

    mvn clean install


Links
-----

Images
~~~~~~

Place images in an ``img`` folder in the directory where the rst file is
located. Use images with:

.. code-block:: rst

     .. figure:: img/thumbprint.png

Code block
~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following directive to highlight code block:


.. code-block:: rst


      .. code-block:: xml


Reference to a section within a file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When creating a new page, add a reference on top of the file:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. _writing-documentation:

This reference could then be used to link to that page or section:

.. code-block:: rst

    :ref:`writing_documentation`


Link to GitHub resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The conf.py contains a set of `external links definition
<http://sphinx-doc.org/latest/ext/extlinks.html>`_.

.. code-block:: rst

   * :issue:`123` to link to an issue
   * :pr:`123` to link to a pull request
   * :code:`web/pom.xml` to link to a file in the source code
   * :repo:`schema_plugins` to link to a repository
   * :wiki:`Meeting2015Bern` to link to a wiki page


Example, link to the Bern User Meeting (See :wiki:`Meeting2015Bern`).


Substitutions
-------------

`Substitutions <http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html#substitutions>`_ are useful
to define a value that's needed in many places (eg. the location
of a file, etc.).

The values are defined in ``rst_epilog`` in conf.py:

.. code-block:: rst

    .. |jdbc.properties| replace:: WEB-INF/config-db/jdbc.properties


Use them when appropriate:

.. code-block:: rst

    Configure the database in |jdbc.properties| ...


    After installation look to |install.homepage|_ on your web browser.



versionadded, versionchanged and deprecated
-------------------------------------------

Use Sphinx's ``versionadded`` and ``versionchanged`` directives to mark new or
changed features. For example:


.. code-block:: rst


    Creating overview from WMS
    ==========================

    .. versionadded:: 3.0

    In the *add overview panel*, select the *add from WMS* link to create
    an image from the WMS referenced in the metadata record to illustrate
    the dataset in a specific area.

    ...

When using the ``versionchanged`` directive, a sentence explaining what
changed is usually relevant:

.. code-block:: rst


    Configuring LDAP
    ================

    .. versionchanged:: 2.10.0
       Previous versions was setting LDAP parameters from the administration
       panel.

    ...


Use ``deprecated`` directive when a feature is no longer available.


seealso
-------

Many sections include a list of references to module documentation or external
documents. These lists are created using the ``seealso`` directive
typically placed in a section just before any subsections.



Translating the doc
===================

`Github doc repository <https://github.com/geonetwork/doc>`_ contains the English version of the documentation. All translations should be done on Transifex web interface. No properties files should be committed to this repository.

If you add some new section or update the text on an existing section, you have to update the Transifex fields to make sure this change is spread to all languages. To achieve this, execute:

To download the translations from Transifex, you will need the Transifex command line client:
https://docs.transifex.com/client/installing-the-client. The Transifex Client is written in Python, so it runs on most systems. The easiest way to install it is with pip.


To install the build tools:

.. code-block:: shell

  sudo pip install sphinx-intl
  sudo pip install transifex-client


Once installed, you need to configure your Transifex user: https://docs.transifex.com/client/client-configuration in `~/.transifexrc`. This config file is unique per user, and it is stored in your home directory.


.. code-block:: none

  [https://www.transifex.com]
  username = your_username/api
  token =
  password = p@ssw0rd/api_token
  hostname = https://www.transifex.com


Update translations on Transifex:

.. code-block:: shell

  make update_translations



If you want to add a new language to the build, you will have to edit the file https://github.com/geonetwork/doc/blob/develop/Makefile#L59 and add the languages you want to build the documentation for.

If you want it to be publicly available on https://geonetwork-opensource.org webpage, make sure you make a PR with the change and ask for advice on the https://github.com/geonetwork/website project.
