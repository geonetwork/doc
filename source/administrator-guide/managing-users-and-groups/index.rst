.. _user-defaults:

Default user
------------

Upon installation a default user with name ``admin`` and password ``admin``
is created. It is recommended to log in with these credentials directly after the installation has completed and to change the default password.


.. _user-session:

User session
------------

After the authentication process, a user session is created. This session will be closed
automatically at some point by the server for security reasons. The default session
timeout is set to 35 min (see :ref:`session-timeout-configuration` for details).

When there is no activity in the browser and the session is about
to expire, a warning is displayed next to the user details 3 minutes before before the timeout takes place:

.. figure:: img/session-will-expire-soon.png

One (1) minute before the timeout, another message is displayed:

.. figure:: img/session-about-to-be-cancelled.png

When the session seems to have been destroyed by the catalog, a message recommends
to refresh the page and sign in again if needed:

.. _user_profiles:

Users, Groups and Roles
-----------------------


The catalog uses the concept of Users, Groups and User Profiles.

- A User can be part of one or more Groups.

- A User has a Role in a Group.

- The Administrator Role is not related to a Group.

The combination of Role and Group defines what tasks the User can perform on the system or on specific metadata records.



Users can have different roles in different groups.
A role defines what tasks the user can perform.

Roles are hierarchical and based on inheritance. This means that a user with an Editor profile can create and modify new metadata records, but can also use all functions a Registered user can use.

Rights associated with the roles are illustrated in detail in the list below:

#.  **Administrator Profile**

    The Administrator has special privileges that give access to all available functions.
    
    These include:
    
    - Full rights for creating new groups and new users
    - Rights to change users/groups profiles
    - Full rights for creating/editing/deleting new/old metadata
    - Perform system administration and configuration tasks.

#.  **User Administrator Profile**

    following privileges:
    
    - Full rights on creating new users within the own group
    - Rights to change users profiles within the own group
    - Full rights on creating/editing/ deleting new/old data within the own group

#.  **Content Reviewer Profile**

    The content reviewer is the only person allowed to give final clearance on    the metadata publication on the Intranet and/or on the Internet:
    
    - Rights on reviewing metadata content within the own group and authorising its publication

    The editor works on metadata with following privileges:
