Setting up search/content statistics
####################################

Since GeoNetwork 3.4 search and content statistics are stored in `ElasticSearch <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch/>`_
using `Kibana <https://www.elastic.co/products/kibana>`_ dashboards to visualize them in the GeoNetwork administration application.

This guide describes the configuration required to integrate ElasticSearch/Kibana in GeoNetwork to store and visualize the search and content statistics.

GeoNetwork 3.8.x supports ElasticSearch/Kibana 7.2, other versions may not work properly.

.. note::  This guide doesn't provide a production level setup for ElasticSearch/Kibana. Please refer to the ElasticSearch/Kibana documentation to do a proper setup/configuration for a production environment.
