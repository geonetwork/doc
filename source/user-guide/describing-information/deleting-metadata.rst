Deleting a record
#################

User must have editing privileges to be able to remove a record.

There are different ways to remove a record:

- In the record view, click the ``delete`` menu
- From the search results, select on or more records and select ``delete``
  in the ``actions on selection`` menu
- In the ``contribute`` section click the ``delete`` button for a record.


Note, if a metadata originates from a harvester, that metadata
will automatically be removed when the metadata in the harvested
system is removed or the harvester itself is removed and the record will
be inserted again on the next harvester run.
