Validating records
##################

In the metadata editor, click the Validate button to trigger the validation.

The right panel displays all validation results by levels:

Click the thumbs up or down icons to display errors. Errors reported in blue are for information only and will not affect the global validation of the record:

The editor also reports error messages where applicable (since not all error messages can be shown in the editor):

Once a record is validated, the validation status is saved and is displayed in the editor board page:

Validation status can be filtered using a facet in the editor board.
Catalog administrators can force validation every time an editor leaves the metadata editing interface (see :ref:`system-configuration`).


To configure validation levels (see :ref:`configure-validation`).

In case of INSPIRE records, remote validator can also be used (see :ref:`inspire-validation`)
