Quick start
###########


GeoNetwork is a catalog application to manage spatially referenced resources.
It provides powerful metadata editing and search functions as well as
an interactive web map viewer. It is currently used in numerous
Spatial Data Infrastructure initiatives across the world.

Apart from how to start the catalog, this Quick Start describes:

* some of the different ways you can search for spatial data
* how to download and display data from the search results


Starting the catalog
--------------------

After going through the installer steps, simply go to bin folder and click
on start.bat (on windows) or startup.sh (on linux).

Open a web browser and go to the GeoNetwork homepage. If you installed it on your computer, this is probably at ``http://localhost:8080/geonetwork``. 

When you use Docker, you can find our what IP and Port to connect to from the Kitematic application. Or run ``docker ps`` in a terminal (on Linux or OSX). This should give you the port the Docker is running on.

From the results or the record view, you can easily add WMS layers referenced in
a metadata record on the map. With the map, you can visualize your data, choose
your background maps, query objects, display on a 3D globe and more ...
