Version 4.0.2
#############

GeoNetwork 4.0.2 release is a minor release but adds a better multilingual support which may require some changes in your installations:

Migration
=========

Migration is only required if you created custom facets configuration or custom Kibana dashboards. Changes are related to name or structure changes in index fields. The changes affect the following type of fields:

Codelist
--------

`codelist_` is now `cl_` and is an object composed of:


So `characterSet` was:

.. code-block:: js

  codelist_characterSet: [
  "utf8"
  ],
  codelist_characterSet_text: [
  "UTF8"
  ],
  codelist_characterSet_text_langeng: [
  "UTF8"
  ],

and is now:

.. code-block:: js

  cl_characterSet: [{
    key: "utf8",
    default: "UTF8",
    langeng: "UTF8",
    link: "http://standards.iso.org/iso/19139/resources/gmxCodelists.xml#MD_CharacterSetCode"
  }]


So if using `codelist_characterSet_text` in a facet, use `cl_characterSet.default` with this new version.

Thesaurus
---------

The `allKeywords` field is now only used for rendering (not for query) to limit the total number of field and avoid some errors on large catalogues.


Use the per thesaurus fields which were named `thesaurus_geonetwork+external/local+type+thesaurusid` and are now `th_thesaurusid`. The field is also an object composed of:

.. code-block:: js

  thesaurus_geonetworkthesaurusexternalthemeeeatopics: [
    "Land use",
    "http://www.eea.europa.eu/portal_vocabularies/themes/landuse",
    "Biodiversity - Ecosystems",
    "http://www.eea.europa.eu/portal_vocabularies/themes/biodiversity"
  ],

and is now:

.. code-block:: js

    th_eea-topics: [{
      default: "Biodiversity - Ecosystems",
      langeng: "Biodiversity - Ecosystems",
      link: "http://www.eea.europa.eu/portal_vocabularies/themes/biodiversity"
    },
    {
      default: "Policy instruments",
      langeng: "Policy instruments",
      link: "http://www.eea.europa.eu/portal_vocabularies/themes/policy"
    }


Topic category
--------------

`topic` is renamed to `cl_topic` and has the same structure as a codelist.
