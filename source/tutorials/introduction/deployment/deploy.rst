Deployment using a war file
###########################

To deploy **GeoNetwork** you just have to place the war file provided or generated on the last optional step on a proper Java container like Tomcat.

To install Tomcat on a debian-based operative system, you can use the apt-get tool like:

  ::

  $ sudo apt-get install tomcat7

Once you have Tomcat installed on your system, locate the webapps folder and place the geonetwork.war file there. This will deploy GeoNetwork on your system.

.. note:: You need to ensure Tomcat is configured with enough memory for GeoNetwork to launch. This can be be configured via the ``setenv`` script in tomcat with the appropriate memory for the JAVA_OPTS property)

Another recommended step on deployment is changing the data directory. The data directory is where GeoNetwork stores all the data files like thumbnails or uploaded documents attached to metadata records. You can start with an empty GeoNetwork directory, it will be automatically populated.

The easiest way to setup the data directory is to update the file **config-spring-geonetwork.xml** available inside the core project:

  ::

  <bean id="GeonetworkDataDirectory" class="org.fao.geonet.kernel.GeonetworkDataDirectory" lazy-init="true">
  <property name="systemDataDir" ref="GNSystemDataDir"/>
  </bean>
  <bean id="GNSystemDataDir" class="java.nio.file.Paths" factory-method="get">
  <constructor-arg index="0" value="/path/to/gn/dir"/>
  <constructor-arg index="1"><array /></constructor-arg>
  </bean>

You can make sure GeoNetwork is deployed on the following url: http://localhost:8080/geonetwork
