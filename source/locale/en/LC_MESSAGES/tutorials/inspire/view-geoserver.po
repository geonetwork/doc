"This tutorial shows how one can set up a combination of GeoServer and "
"GeoNetwork to provide view services following `technical guidelines for "
"view services "

"Note that the technical guidelines allow both `WMS "
"<http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms>`_ as well as `WMTS "
"<http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts>`_. Select the service type"
" which matches your use case or both. WMTS is generally the preferred "
"choice for bigger datasets (facilitates to meet the quality of service "
"requirements). WMS is generally the better choice for datasets with a "
"high update frequency. GeoServer has improved its WMTS support in recent "
"versions (2.10+). Older versions can not be used for providing WMTS "
"according to INSPIRE technical guidelines."
