"A catalog can define a set of categories that can be used to classify "
"metadata records for easy searching or managment purposes (see :ref"
":`managing-categories`). Categories will not be added to the metadata "
"records itself and as such may not be exported when the record is "
"harvested (eg. when using CSW protocol). If the category needs to be "
"propagated with the metadata, use other harvesting protocols (eg. "
"GeoNetwork) or use keywords (see :ref:`tagging-with-keywords`)."
