"THREDDS catalogs describe inventories of datasets. They are organised in "
"a hierarchical manner, listing descriptive information and access methods"
" for each dataset. They typically catalog netCDF datasets but are not "
"restricted to these types of files.  This harvesting type crawls through "
"a THREDDS catalog harvesting metadata for datasets and services described"
" in it or in referenced netCDF datasets. This harvesting type can extract"
" fragments of metadata from the THREDDS catalog, allowing the user to "
"link or copy these fragments into a template to create metadata records."
