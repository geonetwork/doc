"The basics of Atom/OpenSearch is that for each dataset a number of file-"
"downloads in various flavours (language/projection/format) is available. "
"These flavours are advertised in a \"Dataset Atom Feed\" document. A set "
"of \"Dataset Atom Feed\" documents is grouped into a \"Service Atom "
"Feed\" document. For each \"Service Atom Feed\" document an "
"OpenSearchDescription document is available. A website can refer to this "
"OpenSearchDescription document, which enables searching through the "
"download service using the browser search bar (OpenSearch)."

"Currently only the external mode is fully supported. Atom files can be "
"generated in any text or xml editor following the technical guidelines. "
"To optimise the Atom support GeoNetwork uses a convention, which is "
"currently not mandated by the technical guidelines. The convention is "
"that any gmd:MD_Distribution having a link to an Atom file requires the "
"protocol field to contain a defined value to indicate the distribution as"
" being an Atom document. Default value for this protocol is INSPIRE-ATOM,"
" but you can change it using Admin > Settings. The benefit of this "
"approach is that GeoNetwork doesn't need to open any file-link to "
"determine if it is an Atom File. We've seen various member states mandate"
" this convention in localised INSPIRE Technical Guidelines."
