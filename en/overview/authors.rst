Project Steering Committee (PSC)
--------------------------------

The GeoNetwork Project Steering Committee (PSC) makes decisions on
GeoNetwork opensource project issues.

In brief the committee votes on proposals on the  geonetwork-dev mailinglist.
Proposals are available for review for at least two days, and a single veto
is sufficient to delay progress though ultimately a majority of members
can pass a proposal.
