and Water, Health etcetera.

To create new groups you should be logged on with an account that has Administrative privileges.

Access privileges can be set per metadata record. You can define privileges on a per Group basis.

Privileges that can be set relate to visibility of the Metadata (*Publish*),
data *Download*, *Interactive Map* access and display of the record in the *Featured* section of the home page.

*Editing* defines the groups for which editors can edit the metadata record.

*Notify* defines what Groups are notified when a file managed by GeoNetwork is downloaded.
